to-do
- winner is not chosing the real winner
- tranches seem to be mixed up

OPTIMIZATION
Large stack
- first calc moves in b (both R and RR), then moves in a; 

1. find nearest element from the relevant tranche (x steps, RX/RRX)
2. calc where that element would fit in B (y steps RX, z steps RRX)
3. compare the totals for both elements
4. compare the winning total of both elements;
5. overlap is RR/RRR, remainder is RX/RRX 


HOW MANY TRANCHES?
--> 100 items: 7 tranches (then 6, then 8)
--> 500 items: 14 tranches
