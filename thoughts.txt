to-do
- streamline sorting instructions immediately or when printing? 
	(--> printing sounds more doable)
- how to process the instructions in the best way?
	--> for large_stack testing multiple methods, so output only text
- how to optimize reversing the 3-item list (two ways) (maybe not necessary, as it 
	only matters when 6 elements)

small_stack

[- if 1 --> nothing]
- if 2 --> either nothing or swap
- if 3 --> sort_three
- if 4 --> move 1 to b (first one or lowest one?); sort_three, move 1 back to a
- if 5 --> move 2 to b (first two or lowest two?); sort_three, if needed swap 2, move back to a
- if 6 --> move 3 to b (first three or lowest?); sort_three on both stacks, merge
	(then again, if only 3 and 5 get tested...)


large_stack
- measure ways of tranches and choose the shortest one
- make sure B is always sorted


for optimization
- small stack: create program that runs all combinations of 5 numbers 
(and of 6 numbers), counts moves in each
	- then runs most costly scenarios, prints moves into a file, 
	identifies moves for optimization
